# Prescription Maker & Patient App


This is a **Flutter** project demonstrating a simple **doctor-patient prescription workflow** using **Firebase Firestore**. The app includes:

- A **Patient** side, where users can see their profile (with a QR code) and any prescribed medications.
- A **Doctor** side, where doctors can scan the patient’s QR and add prescriptions.

## Overview

This app demonstrates how to:
- Store **patient information** (name, age, meal timings, etc.) in Firestore.
- Generate a **unique patient ID** and display it as a **QR code**.
- Fetch and display a **list of medications** (prescriptions) for a given patient.
- Show a **Profile screen** that includes basic info and the QR code on the same screen.

The **QR code** allows a doctor’s app (or “Doctor Mode”) to quickly scan and link to the correct patient’s data in Firestore, simplifying the prescription process.

---

## Features

1. **Profile Screen**  
   - Displays the patient’s name, age, meal timings, and a QR code for their unique ID.  
   - The layout has two sections:  
     - A top area for the QR code  
     - A bottom gray area for patient details  

2. **Medications Screen** (Patient Home)  
   - Lists all prescribed medications from the Firestore subcollection (`/patients/{patientId}/medications`).  
   - If no medications are found, it shows a placeholder text (“No prescriptions or medicines added yet.”).  

3. **Realtime Firestore Updates**  
   - Uses **StreamBuilder** to automatically refresh medication data whenever the database changes.  

4. **Firebase Integration**  
   - Configured via **FlutterFire CLI** or manual setup (`firebase_core`, `cloud_firestore`).  

5. **QR Code Generation**  
   - Uses the [qr_flutter](https://pub.dev/packages/qr_flutter) package to display the unique patient ID as a QR code.

---
